          <h3>Yosemite</h3>
          <p>
            Yosemite National Park is in California’s Sierra Nevada mountains.
            It’s famed for its giant, ancient sequoia trees, and for Tunnel
            View, the iconic vista of towering Bridalveil Fall and the granite
            cliffs of El Capitan and Half Dome. In Yosemite Village are shops,
            restaurants, lodging, the Yosemite Museum and the Ansel Adams
            Gallery, with prints of the photographer’s renowned black-and-white
            landscapes of the area.
